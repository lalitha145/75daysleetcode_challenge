Day 10:

1) Fibonacci Number
The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,

F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1.


Code:

class Solution {
    public int fib(int n) {
      int first=0;
      int second=1;
      int third=0;
      if(n==1){
          return 1;
      }
      for(int i=2;i<=n;i++){
          third=first+second;
          first=second;
          second=third;

      }
      return third;
    }
}



2)Climbing Stairs

You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
Example 2:

Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step

Code:

class Solution {
    public int climbStairs(int n) {
        int first=1;
        int second=1;
        int ans=0;
        if(n==1){
            return 1;
        }
        for(int i=2;i<=n;i++){
            ans=first+second;
            second=first;
            first=ans;
            
        }
        return ans;

    }
}
