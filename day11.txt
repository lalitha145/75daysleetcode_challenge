Day 11

1)Min Cost Climbing Stairs

You are given an integer array cost where cost[i] is the cost of ith step on a staircase. Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps.

You can either start from the step with index 0, or the step with index 1.

Return the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor.

 

Example 1:

Input: cost = [10,15,20]
Output: 15
Explanation: You will start at index 1.
- Pay 15 and climb two steps to reach the top.
The total cost is 15.
Example 2:

Input: cost = [1,100,1,1,1,100,1,1,100,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: You will start at index 0.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 2.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 4.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 6.
- Pay 1 and climb one step to reach index 7.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 9.
- Pay 1 and climb one step to reach the top.
The total cost is 6.

Code:

class Solution {
    public int minCostClimbingStairs(int[] cost) {
        int n = cost.length;
        
        return solve3(cost,n);
    }
    
    public int solve3(int[] cost, int n){
        int prev2 = cost[0];
        int prev1 = cost[1];

        for(int i = 2;i<n;i++){
            int curr = cost[i] + Math.min(prev1,prev2);
            prev2 = prev1;
            prev1 = curr;
        }
        return Math.min(prev1,prev2);
    }
}



2)Unique Paths

There is a robot on an m x n grid. The robot is initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Given the two integers m and n, return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.

The test cases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 109.

 

Example 1:


Input: m = 3, n = 7
Output: 28
Example 2:

Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Down


  Code:

class Solution {
    public int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        int [][] grid = new int [m][n];
        for(int k = 0; k < m; k++) grid[k][0] = 1;
        for(int k = 0; k < n; k++) grid[0][k] = 1;

        for(int k = 0; k < m; k++)
        {
            for(int j = 0; j < n; j++)
            {
                if(grid[k][j] == 1) continue;
                else
                {
                    grid[k][j] = grid[k-1][j] + grid[k] [j-1]; 
                }
            }
        }
        return grid[m-1][n-1];
    }
}
