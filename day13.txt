Day 13:
1) Two Sum
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]

Code:
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
      HashMap<Integer,Integer> map=new HashMap<>();
      int n=nums.length;
      for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
          int compliment=target-nums[i];
          if(map.containsKey(compliment)){
              return new int[]{map.get(compliment),i};
              }
               map.put(nums[i],i);
          }
      return new int[]{-1,-1};
      
    }
}



2 ) Bulls and Cows
You are playing the Bulls and Cows game with your friend.

You write down a secret number and ask your friend to guess what the number is. When your friend makes a guess, you provide a hint with the following info:

The number of "bulls", which are digits in the guess that are in the correct position.
The number of "cows", which are digits in the guess that are in your secret number but are located in the wrong position. Specifically, the non-bull digits in the guess that could be rearranged such that they become bulls.
Given the secret number secret and your friend's guess guess, return the hint for your friend's guess.

The hint should be formatted as "xAyB", where x is the number of bulls and y is the number of cows. Note that both secret and guess may contain duplicate digits.

 

Example 1:

Input: secret = "1807", guess = "7810"
Output: "1A3B"
Explanation: Bulls are connected with a '|' and cows are underlined:
"1807"
  |
"7810"
Example 2:

Input: secret = "1123", guess = "0111"
Output: "1A1B"
Explanation: Bulls are connected with a '|' and cows are underlined:
"1123"        "1123"
  |      or     |
"0111"        "0111"
Note that only one of the two unmatched 1s is counted as a cow since the non-bull digits can only be rearranged to allow one 1 to be a bull.


Code:

class Solution {
    public String getHint(String secret, String guess) {
        HashMap<Character,Integer>map=new HashMap<>();
        int bull=0,cow=0;
        int i=0;
        
        while(i<secret.length()){
            char s=secret.charAt(i);char g=guess.charAt(i);
            if(s==g){
                bull++;
            } 
            else{
                if(map.containsKey(s)){
                    map.put(s,map.get(s)+1);
                }
                else{
                    map.put(s,1);
                }
            }
            i++;
        }

        i=0;

        while(i<guess.length()){
            char s=secret.charAt(i);char g=guess.charAt(i);
            if(s!=g){
                if(map.containsKey(g)){
                    cow++;
                    if(map.get(g)==1){
                        map.remove(g);
                    }
                    else{
                        map.put(g,map.get(g)-1);
                    }
                }
            }
            i++;
        }

        return bull+"A"+cow+"B";
    }
}
